The Autodidactic Iteration (ADI) algorithm, also known as the "self-teaching" algorithm, 
is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis to iteratively improve a model's performance
by incorporating its own predictions as training data. 
The algorithm is designed to handle unlabeled data and learn from its own predictions.

Since ADI is more of a general concept rather than a specific algorithm with a fixed implementation, 
I'll provide a simple pseudo-code for the Autodidactic Iteration algorithm:
'''
# Pseudocode for Autodidactic Iteration (ADI) Algorithm
def autodidactic_iteration(data, model, num_iterations):
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        # Step 1: Use the current model to predict labels for unlabeled data
        predictions = model.predict(data['unlabeled'])

        # Step 2: Add predicted labels to the labeled data
        data['labeled']['labels'] = predictions

        # Step 3: Retrain the model using both labeled and newly predicted data
        model.train(data['labeled'])

    return model
'''
Please note that the actual implementation of the ADI algorithm will depend on the 
specific model you are using and the data format it requires for training and prediction.
The core idea is to use the model's predictions on unlabeled data to create "pseudo-labels,"
and then use this expanded labeled dataset to retrain the model iteratively.
The process continues until convergence or a predefined number of iterations. 
The algorithm effectively leverages the model's own predictions to improve its performance on unlabeled data.
